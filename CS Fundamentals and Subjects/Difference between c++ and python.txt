Python	
Python has less lines of code.	
Python supports garbage collection	
Python is easy to remember almost similar to human language.	
Python uses interpreter.	
Python is slower since it uses interpreter and also determines the data type at run time.	
Rapid Prototyping is possible due to the small size of the code.	
Easier to maintain, object-oriented and simpler to use
Python is dynamically typed.
Python program are saved with .py extension.

C++
C++ tends to have large lines of code.
C++ doesnâ€™t support garbage collection.
C++ has a stiff learning curve as it has lots of predefined syntaxes and structure.
C++ is pre; compiled.
C++ is faster in speed as compared to python.	
C++ is statically typed.C++ program are saved with .cpp extension.	
Less clean and manageable in comparison to python
